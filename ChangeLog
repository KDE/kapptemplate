Nov-02-1999 - Kurt Granroth (v0.4)
  o Updated for KDE 2.x.  The produced application now has a LOT more
    functionality than before -- it is a scriptable web browser (see
    dcopclient.py for more info on that)!

Jan-24-1999 - Kurt Granroth (v0.3.2)
  o Added LIB_X11 and LIB_QT to acinclude.m4

Jan-18-1999 - Kurt Granroth (v0.3.1)
  o AUGH!! I forgot 'acinclude.m4'!!
  o Slightly modified 'install-me' so that kapptemplate will install from
    CVS.  It was wigging out when it tried to cp the CVS directory...
  
Jan-01-1999 - Kurt Granroth (v0.3)
  o Added kapptemplate to kdesdk
  o HUGE clean-up of code
  o Put in some session management stuff
  o Changed main() to use 'App *widget = new App;' instead of 'App widget'.
    The latter case caused the app to seg fault if the user closed it
    any way other than File->Quit

Dec-31-1998 - Kurt Granroth
  o Added 'knewfunction' module that will add a function to an existing
    class

Dec-27-1998 - Kurt Granroth
  o Split kapptemplate into modules.  Added 'knewclass' module that will
    create a new class

Dec-25-1998 - Kurt Granroth (v0.2.2)
  o Fixed bug in App class where AppWidget needed 'this' parent
  o Added 'pics' directory

Dec-18-1998 - Kurt Granroth
  o Added patch from Helmut Bohr <Helmut.Bohr@t-online.de> to properly
    escape backquotes in po-Makefile.am
  o Changed 'cp' to 'cp -p' to hopefully preserve executable permissions
    where needed.

Dec-04-1998 - Kurt Granroth (v0.2.1)
  o released 0.2.1
