  o Use KAboutData and KCmdLineArgs

Dec-28-1999 - Kurt Granroth (v0.5.1)
  o The po Makefile now uses the autogenerated rules.  I don't know
    why I didn't notice that capability before

Dec-25-1999 - Kurt Granroth (v0.5)
  o Use standard actions instead of constructing everything manually
    (big change!)
  o Allow .po files to be installed in $DESTDIR
  o Added .spec file for RPM fans

Dec-05-1999 - Kurt Granroth (v0.4.5)

Nov-20-1999 - Kurt Granroth (v0.4.2)
  o Use mkinstalldirs instead of mkdir

Nov-04-1999 - Kurt Granroth (v0.4.1)
  o Removed a few files from common/ that are in admin/ (missing,
    install-sh, mkinstalldirs)
  o Renamed .png files to "proper" naming convention
  o Got rid of admin/ directory from CVS.  It is now copied over from
    the common admin directory (found in kdesdk/admin).  This should
    prevent a lot of redundent updates

Nov-02-1999 - Kurt Granroth (v0.4)
  o Updated for KDE 2.x.  The produced application now has a LOT more
    functionality than before -- it is a scriptable web browser (see
    dcopclient.py for more info on that)!

Jan-18-1999 - Kurt Granroth (v0.3.1)
  o AUGH!! I forgot 'acinclude.m4'!!

  o Added kapptemplate to kdesdk
  o HUGE clean-up of code

    any way other than File->Quit
