PyKDE4 Application Template
---------------------------

You need PyKDE4 from your distribution.

To run the template: 
first generate the python module from the Designer myCalendar.ui file
pykdeuic4 -o myCalendar.py myCalendar.ui
then start your project:
python APPNAME.py
(where you replace APPNAME by your project name)

Warning: in Oxygen style, the menus are not seen, you need to set another style in System Settings!
