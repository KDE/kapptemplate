%{APPNAME}Shape.(h|cpp):
Data representation and painting should be implemented here.
Do not put heavy code into the constructor, therefore you should use the activate()-method!

%{APPNAME}Tool.(h|cpp):
A tool to modify the shape.
Do not use paint() to display real data, it is only for "decorations", hints while modifying the shape.

%{APPNAME}Widget.(h|cpp):
This widget will be displayed inside a docker. Here you can place inputs to modify your shape.

%{APPNAME}(Shape|Tool)Factory.(h|cpp):
Factories to create shapes and tools.

%{APPNAME}Plugin.(h|cpp):
Will be loaded by KOffice, here the factories are registered.

%{APPNAMELC}shape.desktop:
The .desktop file with meta-data.

CMakeLists.txt:
A build file.
You may want to link against additional KOffice-libraries like kobase, kotext or pigmentcms.
