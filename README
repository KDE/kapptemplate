KAppTemplate v1.0
Kurt Granroth <granroth@kde.org>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is it?
-----------
KAppTemplate is a shell script that will create the necessary
framework to develop various KDE applications.  It takes care of the
autoconf/automake code as well as providing a skeleton and example of
what the code typically looks like.

Currently, KAppTemplate creates four different types of frameworks:

1) Full featured KDE application

   This is a "normal" KDE application with nearly every bleeding edge
   feature.

2) KPart application

   This creates a KDE application that uses KParts as both the Shell
   and the Part (KParts::MainWindow and KParts::ReadWritePart)

3) KPart plugin

   This creates a sample KPart plugin that acts on KHTMLPart

4) Existing application conversion

   This will take existing source and put it in a KDE automake/autoconf
   framework

What is a framework?
--------------------
When I say "framework", I mean all of the source files as well as the
autoconf/automake stuff.  When KAppTemplate is done, all you will need
to do to compile and install your app is:
    ./configure
    make && make install

What do I need to use this?
---------------------------
o KDE 2.x
o autoconf
o automake

To generate your app's documentation, you'll also need ksgml2html
(from the 'kdesdk' package)

How do I install it?
--------------------
./install-me

How does <whatever> work?
-------------------------
Before you email me, look through the kapptemplate file.  It is a
shell script so it should be pretty easy to understand what is going
on.

I have a suggest, question, or comment
--------------------------------------
Well, email me, then!

Have fun!
