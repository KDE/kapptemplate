KAppTemplate v0.7.2
Kurt Granroth <granroth@kde.org>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is it?
-----------
KAppTemplate is a shell script that will create the necessary
framework to develop a KDE 2.x KMainWindow-based KDE app.

What else is it?
----------------
There are two other scripts that are distributed with KAppTemplate:
KNewClass and KNewFunction.  They will create a new class and a new
function, respectively.  However, they both are terrible.  I'll either
nuke them or really implement them someday.

What is a framework?
--------------------
When I say "framework", I mean all of the source files as well as the
autoconf/automake stuff.  When KAppTemplate is done, all you will need
to do to compile and install your app is:
    ./configure
    make && make install

What do I need to use this?
---------------------------
o KDE 2.x ("HEAD" CVS branch)
o autoconf
o automake

To generate your app's documentation, you'll also need
o ksgml2html (from the 'kdesdk' package)

How do I install it?
--------------------
./install-me

Why does it have a DCOP interface and use KParts?
-------------------------------------------------
Because both are The Right Thing to Do(tm).  If you have a
full-featured KDE application at all, you should use all the tools
necessary.  A DCOP interface is very necessary if you want any kind of
interoperability between your app and other apps.  And using the KPart
component for HTML is preferred to using the KHTML widget directly.
In fact, whenever there is a component that can handle your data,
always prefer it over a plain widget.  With a component, your app can
react to user preferences and component updates on the fly... with a
widget, you would need to recompile.

How does <whatever> work?
-------------------------
Before you email me, look through the kapptemplate file.  It is a
shell script so it should be pretty easy to understand what is going
on.

I have a suggest, question, or comment
--------------------------------------
Well, email me, then!

Have fun!
