KAppTemplate v0.3.1
Kurt Granroth <granroth@kde.org>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is it?
-----------
KAppTemplate is a shell script that will create the necessary framework
to develop a KTMainWindow-based KDE app.

What else is it?
----------------
There are two other scripts that are distributed with KAppTemplate: KNewClass
and KNewFunction.  They will create a new class and a new function,
respectively.

What is a framework?
--------------------
When I say "framework", I mean all of the source files as well as the
autoconf/automake stuff.  When KAppTemplate is done, all you will need
to do to compile and install your app is:
	./configure
	make && make install

What do I need to use this?
---------------------------
o KDE 1.1 (snapshots or CVS if 1.1 hasn't been released yet)
o autoconf
o automake

To generate your app's documentation, you'll also need
o ksgml2html (from the 'kdesdk' package)

How do I install it?
--------------------
./install-me

How does <whatever> work?
-------------------------
Before you email me, look through the kapptemplate file.  It is a shell
script so it should be pretty easy to understand what is going on.

I have a suggest, question, or comment
--------------------------------------
Well, email me, then!

Have fun!
