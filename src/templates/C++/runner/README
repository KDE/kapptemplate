Runner Template
----------------------

-- Build instructions --

cd /where/your/runner/is/installed
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIRS .. 
make 
make install

(your $KDEDIRS is where you install your KDE 4)

Restart plasma to load the runner: in a terminal, run the 2 following commands:
kquitapp plasma-desktop
plasma-desktop

Alt-F2 to launch KRunner and in the runners list you will find your runner.

You might need to run kbuildsycoca4
in order to get the .desktop file recognized.
