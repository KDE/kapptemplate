Runner Template
----------------------

-- Build instructions --

cd /where/your/runner/is/installed
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIRS .. (-DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=ON)
make 
make install

(your $KDEDIRS is where you install your KDE 4)
(depending on the platform you have to use the Qt installation paths)

Restart plasma to load the runner: in a terminal, run the following command:

kbuildsycoca5

After this you should see your runner in the system settings:

systemsettings5 (Head to "Search")

You can also launch KRunner via Alt-F2 and you will find your runner.
