This is what I think needs to be done in KAppTemplate for the KDE4 release.

** Write a doc for newdeveloper.kde.org to explain what the templates are and how to generate them.

KAPP4
kapp4 is a kde4 base application featuring KConfig XT and a GUI with a ui file from designer. Will need update if config system changes. Should include all base KDE4 technologies.

What is missing:
- add dbus support
- icons subdir in kapp4
- po subdir in kapp4
- doc subdir in kapp4

KPARTAPP
- make a similar template

EXISTING
- port (should not be too difficult)

KPARTPLUGIN
- is it necessary?

APPFRAMEWORK
- suppress folder as it installs automake-related stuff
