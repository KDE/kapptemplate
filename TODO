This is what I think needs to be done in KAppTemplate for the KDE4 release.

** Write a doc for newdeveloper.kde.org to explain what the templates are and how to generate them. Base that on the KDE-Women article at http://women.kde.org/articles/tutorials/kde4_template/

KAPP4
kapp4 is a kde4 base application featuring KConfig XT and a GUI with a ui file from designer. Will need update if config system changes. Should include all base KDE4 technologies.

What is missing:
- add dbus support
- icons subdir in kapp4
- po subdir in kapp4
- doc subdir in kapp4
- printing support?
- drag & drop? 

KAPP
- see if KAPP4 does the job - if so, remove. If not, port.

KPARTAPP
- to port to kde4 and to modernize - same as above, should include the latest stuff

EXISTING
not sure what purpose it has...
- port if someone convince me it's useful (should not be too difficult) 

KPARTPLUGIN
- is it necessary to have that as a template? if so, port. If not, suppress

APPFRAMEWORK
- suppress folder as it installs automake-related stuff
